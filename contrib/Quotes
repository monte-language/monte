<simpson> I mean, to be frank, at some point this is all Prolog reinvention.
<simpson> But whatever.
<dash> sure
<dash> the problem is that the good parts of prolog are all locked away in... prolog implementations
*time passes*
<dash> simpson: i guess we have about half a prolog now
<simpson> dash: Which is appropriate. That's what's supposed to happen, right? We are now complex enough to have an ill-specified and slightly buggy reimplementation of Prolog in our system.
<dash> yeah! we're ahead of all those other suckers who got common lisp instead

<simpson> monteBot: speak
<monteBot> Hi there!
<simpson> Okay, the latency's good now.
<dash> monteBot: kill
