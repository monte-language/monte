Monte
=====

A dynamic language inspired by Python and E.

[Monte's documentation](http://monte.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) is 
on readthedocs. Please remember that Monte is a very new language being worked
on by 4 busy people in their free time, so the docs probably won't answer all
of your questions yet. 

Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/monte-language/monte/issues/new)
if you have a problem with the docs, telling us what question you had and
where you expected to find the answer. Or come say hi on IRC, in #monte on
irc.freenode.net!
