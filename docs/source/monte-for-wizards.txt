* Monte For Wizards
** Why Monte?
Every new language should have a justification for its existence.
*** Inspired by E and Python
Monte right now is E with slightly different syntax and changed iteration semantcs.
For a history of E's ideas, see http://www.erights.org/history/index.html
*** Intended for networked and distributed systems
*** Goal of supporting 10x the complexity of Python
** Key Principles
*** Time and state
**** Event loop
**** Deterministic turns
**** Immutable objects
*** Concurrency and IO
**** Promises
**** Vats
**** Tubes
**** Lack of blocking APIs
*** Readable code
**** Lack of mutable globals
**** Objects, no classes
**** Guards and interfaces
**** Auditors
*** Object-capability security
**** Encapsulation
**** Ejectors
**** POLA in library design
** Sketch of semantics
*** system-level view
Monte programs are a collection of vats, running in one or more
processes on one or more hosts.  Vats contain three elements: a stack,
a queue, and a heap. All three contain Monte objects. The queue
contains messages to objects in the heap; messages consist of a verb
and may contain objects passed as arguments. Execution of code in a
vat progresses by turns; each turn is started by delivering the next
message in the queue to its recipient, which can result in activation
records being placed on the stack and further messages going into the
queue. The turn progresses until the stack is empty. A new turn begins
with the next message on the queue.
*** object-level view
Monte is a pure object-oriented language in the Smalltalk
tradition. All values are objects and all computation is done by
sending messages to objects. Unlike Smalltalk, Python, Java, etc.,
objects are not instances of classes. Unlike Self or Javascript,
objects are not derived from prototypes. Monte objects are defined via
object literal syntax as closures over variable bindings. Specifically
unlike Python, objects don't have attributes, merely responses to
messages.
*** method-level view
Monte provides both immediate, synchronous calls to methods and
eventual, asynchronous sends to methods. The former provides the usual
subroutine-invocation semantics, whereas the latter enqueues a message
to be delivered in a subsequent vat turn. Monte Names for objects are
encapsulated in bindings.
*** binding semantics
A Monte name binding consists of a slot and a slot guard. Assignment
to names and accessing names invokes methods on that name's slot. This
can be used to share state between objects, and perform actions on
reads from/writes to names. Slot guards for bindings closed over an
object are revealed to auditors, during auditing.
*** Guards and interfaces
Name bindings may have guards, which are given objects and may either
accept, coerce, or reject them. Coercion results in the value produced
by the guard being different from the specimen given. The specimen may
be asked to conform itself to the guard as part of coercion.

Interface expressions are a tool for creating trivial guards; an
object expression may declare that it implements an interface, and the
interface object may be used as a guard to accept only objects that
declare that interface.
*** Reference semantics
This is a big topic and you should read
http://www.erights.org/elib/concurrency/refmech.html for now.
** Syntax
Monte's syntax is largely C-derived with an offside rule like Python's
and Haskell's. However, it's an expression language like Scheme. The
compromise is achieved by using braces and semicolons to delineate
blocks and separate expressions in general, but use indentation and
newlines for this in "statement position", which is chiefly the
toplevel of the file and inside an indented block.
**** Pattern matching
Patterns attempt to match objects and either succeed or fail.
***** Usage
There are five places where patterns are used:
****** Method parameters
Parameters to methods are patterns which are matched against
arguments. Match failure raises an exception.
****** Matchers
match patt {}
When 'match' is used in an object expression, 'patt' is
matched against a message (a [verb, arglist] pair) sent to the object.
****** def expressions
def patt := val

The pattern 'patt' is matched against the object 'val' and an
exception is raised if the match fails.

def patt exit e := val

The pattern 'patt' is matched against the object 'val' and the ejector
'e' is invoked if the match fails.

****** Match-bind expressions
val =~ patt

The pattern 'patt' is matched against the object 'val'. If the match
fails, 'false' is returned. On success, 'true' is returned.

val !~ patt

The pattern 'patt' is matched against the object 'val'. If the match
fails, 'true' is returned. On success, 'false' is returned.
****** Switch expressions
switch (val) {
    match patt1 {}
    match patt2 {}
}

The pattern 'patt1' is matched against the object 'val'. If the match
fails, the next matcher is invoked, matching 'patt2' against
'val'. The first pattern to match results in its associated block
being evaluated. If no patterns match, an exception is raised.
***** Patterns
****** FinalPattern
x
::"hello, world"
x :G

Final patterns match an object and bind a name to them, optionally
testing them for guard conformance. Guard conformance
failure causes pattern match failure.
****** VarPattern
var x
var ::"hello, world"
var x :G

Var patterns match an object and bind a mutable name to them,
optionally testing them for guard conformance. Guard
conformance failure causes pattern match failure. Later assignments to
'x' will be tested for guard conformance as well.
****** BindPattern
bind x
bind x ::"hello, world"
bind x :G

Bind patterns match an object and bind it to a forward-declared name,
optionally testing for guard conformance.

****** SlotPattern
&x
&::"hello, world"
&x :G

Slot patterns match an object and bind them to the slot of the
pattern's name, optionally testing the object for guard conformance.
****** BindingPattern
&&x
&&::"hello, world"

Binding patterns match an object and use it as the binding for the
given name.
****** IgnorePattern
_
_ :G

IgnorePattern matches an object, optionally requiring conformance to a
guard.
****** ListPattern
[p, q]
[p, q] + rest

List patterns match lists, matching each subpattern against the items
in the list.  if '+' is used, a list pattern of size N is matched
against the first N items in the list, and the 'rest' pattern is
matched against the remaining items. If '+' is not used the list
pattern only matches lists of the same size.
****** MapPattern
["k1" => p, (k2) => q]
["k1" => p := v1, (k2) => q := v2]
["k1" => p, "k2" => q] | rest
[=> p, => q]

Map patterns match maps. Keys are either literal strings or
expressions in parentheses. The subpatterns are matched against the
values for the keys. ':=' may be used to specify a default value to
match a subpattern against if the key is absent.

The 'importer' syntax without keys is a shortcut for binding names
identical to string keys in a map; '[=> x, => y]' is equivalent to
'["x" => x, "y" => y]'.
****** SamePattern
==val

Same patterns match objects that compare same to their value.
****** NotSamePattern
!=val

Not-same patterns match objects that do not compare same to their value.
****** QuasiliteralPattern
foo`some text @p more text @{q :G} ...`

Quasiliteral patterns invoke a quasiparser with text containing
pattern holes. The resulting matcher object is invoked with the object
to be matched, and the patterns in the holes are matched against the
specimens it extracts.
****** ViaPattern
via (a) p
****** SuchThatPattern
p ? a
****** CallPattern
a(p, q)

** Tour of implementation

*** lexer.py
Responsible for breaking up Monte source code into tokens.
MonteLexer.getNextToken is the primary routine in this module. This
code was copied from an earlier design and has been heavily modified
since. Rewriting it to be simpler would be great -- possibly with an
explicit state machine for recognizing partial and complete inputs, to
allow easy implementation of a REPL.

SourceSpan and friends are used to track the location of tokens in the
file they were parsed from.
*** parser.py
Monte uses a Parsley grammar with a couple unusual modifications;
EParserBase overrides some core Parsley rules to make the grammar
parse a sequence of tokens rather than a string of characters. The
other unusual piece is convertInfix; instead of expressing infix
syntax as Parsley rules, the shunting yard algorithm is used to
properly nest binary operators by precedence.
*** monte.parsley
The Monte grammar produces a term-tree AST from a sequence of tokens.
*** expander.py
The entry point for this code is expand(), which takes a Monte AST and
produces a Kernel-E AST from it. It uses Parsley in a somewhat odd
way, doing recursive matching on tree nodes. One tree traversal is
done to collect scope information -- names used and names bound in a
subtree. The other is done to convert each syntax node to its
expansion.
*** compiler.py
This compiler takes a Kernel-E AST and generates a Python module from
it. Object expressions are translated into Python classes, and Monte
methods are translated into Python methods. Ejectors are translated to
unique exception classes.
*** runtime/
Implementation of various core objects. runtime/base.py contains
MonteObject, the common superclass for all objects used in Monte.
** Unresolved design questions
*** Syntax
*** Module system
*** Library packaging
*** Python<->E interoperability
