Toolchain around Monte and its documentation
============================================

Restructured text
-----------------

The docs are written in `restructured text`_. 

Sphinx
------

The docs are built with `Sphinx`_ and hosted on `readthedocs`_. 

The virtualenv for building the docs is separate from the main Monte
virtualenv. Create a separate virtualenv and ``pip install -r
docs_requirements.txt``, then ``make html`` to make the docs. Locally built
docs will show up in the docs/build directory. 

Travis
------

`Travis`_ is used for Monte's continuous integration testing. This means that
it will automatically rebuild and test the project every time a commit is
pushed or branch is merged into master. 

Since we don't need to run the tests and spam the IRC channel every time a
change is pushed to the documentation, it's possible to make Travis skip
building a given commit by adding ``[skip ci]`` or ``[ci skip]`` to the body
of the commit message. There are more docs on skipping commits `here`_.
